#Sentiment Analysis on Financial News (In Progress)

Overview  
This project focuses on performing sentiment analysis on financial news articles. The aim is to classify the sentiment of news articles into categories such as positive, negative, or neutral. The project utilizes a neural network model built with the TensorFlow library, leveraging data sourced from Kaggle.

Business Problem  
In the fast-paced world of finance, the sentiment expressed in news articles can significantly influence market movements and investor decisions. However, manually analyzing the vast amount of financial news published daily is impractical. There is a need for an automated system that can quickly and accurately assess the sentiment of financial news to assist investors and financial analysts in making informed decisions.

Business Case  
Why Sentiment Analysis on Financial News?  
- Market Prediction: Sentiment analysis can help predict market trends by identifying the general mood or sentiment of the market from news articles.
- Investment Strategies: Investors can use sentiment analysis to refine their investment strategies, potentially improving returns by aligning with positive sentiment or avoiding negative sentiment.
- Risk Management: Financial institutions can better manage risks by monitoring sentiment trends, helping them anticipate market volatility or shifts.
- Competitive Advantage: Firms with access to real-time sentiment analysis have a competitive edge in making timely and informed decisions.
